## Design Philosophy (Updated)

### Key Changes Made:

- **Teal & Orange as Stars**: Used your original colors (#14b8a6, #2dd4bf, #fb923c, #ffa726) for the most important syntax elements
- **Prominent Roles**: Functions, keywords, strings, numbers get your signature colors
- **Closer to Originals**: Increased saturation while keeping eye-friendly backgrounds
- **Main Character Treatment**: Import statements, prompts, and key UI elements use your exact colors

### Coding-Specific Roles for Your Colors:

- **Functions**: Your exact teal - functions are the stars of code
- **Keywords**: Bright teal variants - if/else/const/let deserve attention
- **Strings**: Your orange family - strings appear everywhere
- **Numbers**: Your exact orange - numbers need to pop
- **Terminal Prompts**: Your teal - the command line identity
- **Paths**: Your orange - easy wayfinding

### Balance Achieved:

- **Your Identity**: Teal and orange are clearly recognizable as YOUR colors
- **Eye Comfort**: Backgrounds remain gentle for long coding sessions
- **Hierarchy**: Most important code elements get the star treatment

Your themes now feel unmistakably like **YOUR** brand while being sustainable for development work!
